Button names are confusing

Buttons to add size to the scene are hard to understand because nothing on the screen changes. 

It is a lot of work to change all the properties of an entity and presets should be easier to use. 

Text is black and background is black in a lot of places. 

Possibly make entity editor less confined. 

Gameplay is choppy.

Add help button to explain buttons. 

Component Names are hard to understand.
