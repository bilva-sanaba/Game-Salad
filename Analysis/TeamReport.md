CompSci 308: Team Review
===================

## Team
 
### Team Work Environment

The team work environment for this project was great. We all got along really well, and typically everyone was available to work on the project or just help out. When the whole team got together, we were productive and also had a lot of fun. In my subgroup—game player—my partner (Henry) and I had a good working relationship. We worked well together when we coded as a pair, and also hit our deadlines for the work we delegated to each other individually.

Additionally, answer the following questions:
#### What were your team's goals for the project and do you think they were clear to everyone?

For the project, we hoped to create a functional and extendable game that boasted a variety of features. We planned out a lot in the beginning, but as the project developed, we made design decisions to not include some features. Additionally, we added several features not originally considered. There probably could have been better communication between game authoring and game engine/game player, as a lot of the features in game engine/game player could not be added by the user in the authoring environment because the authoring environment team did not know about everything that we had added.


#### How was work divided among the team members and do you think everyone was clear about their responsibilities?

The work was divided pretty well among the team members. Anticipating that game authoring environment and game engine would be the most substantial portions, we assigned three people to each. Two of us worked on game player, and one person handled data because it definitely required the least amount of work. Additionally, once data was finished, our assigned team member transitioned to authoring environment and helped them extensively. All in all, the work was divided among team members pretty easily. As mentioned, game player/game engine could have communicated better with game authoring environment about the progress we were making because—to be honest—we were a little ahead of where they were throughout the project, and game authoring environment was unable to add functionality to fully include all of the features that we included. If we had known where game authoring was, we would have added less and assisted more with their functionality. 

#### How was the communication within the team (was it too much, too little, just right) and why?

Communication within the team was substantial. Again, I felt that game authoring and game engine/game player could have communicated better, but other than that, the team met frequently and discussed design a lot. I would say that the communication was just right—at least from my end (in game player)—because we discussed a lot with game engine. Maybe, even too much, but evidently could have been talking more with game authoring, because while game engine knew about our features and wrote the code to implement game-authoring passed input so that the features would work, game authoring did not create the opportunity for the user to add such features.

#### How clear was the work flow of committing code and how easy did it make sharing progress and why?

The work flow of committing code was very clear because we got together in the same room pretty regularly and went through committing in a very explicit process, i.e. saying “I’m committing” or “I’m gonna push,” but we definitely could have been clearer with our messages so that everyone knew when functionalities were added to the project, especially towards the end.

#### For any team mate you rated higher than a 2 or lower than a -2, provide specific details for your evaluation

jfb25: Did a solid job with the authoring environment. Added really cool right-click feature. He could have been more honest and more regular with his authoring environment updates.

jmk86: Was done quickly with game data, and then helped out with the authoring environment substantially.

hsp8: When Hamsa worked on the project, he was pretty effective. He, Bilva and I worked on rewind together, which was a really cool feature; however, it took him too long to implement a working collision engine which was his primary contribution to the project.

jr286: A very diligent worker and the backbone of the game-authoring environment. He was always around to talk about the general design of the project and to incorporate authoring options for features implemented in the backend. 

bgs21: Bilva was the team leader. He spent a lot of time on this project and was always around to communicate. The involvement of the other team members working on his portion—game engine—was less frequent and so Bilva did most of the work for that section. 

bt72: Belal probably could have spent a little more time on this project, but when he was around, his contribution was great. The camera was really cool.

Hjt8: Henry is a really good coder. Henry and I worked on game player and his contribution to the project was immense. He wrote the Facebook utility and the user database. Henry could have been a little more present for team project meetings and we had one design disagreement that will be explained in the written analysis, but other than that, he was great. The project would not have been completed without him.

Jy83: Justin contributed and is a solid coder, but he disappeared halfway through the project and could have worked with game authoring earlier on so that there weren’t as many issues as we had the night before presentations. We could have been finished earlier and incorporated more of the backend/game player features if authoring had been more ready. Justin really put in work at the last second, though. 


## Personal

### My Rating

+5. I don’t know if I have been overly generous on ratings, but relative to what I gave everyone else, this is what I deserve. I wrote the controller and the animation in game view and included several features such as splash screens for specific games and achievements. Additionally, I implemented the structure for the observers with Henry and worked closely with the game engine so that whatever features they added could be incorporated and displayed on the game screen/HUD, such as object creation/deletion, including gifs and changing player’s image based on key inputs. One feature that I implemented was the rewind feature, which backend and I worked on. Originally, rewind was to be included in the animation, back before observers were used, and we had access to the game engine, but we edited controller so that step was called on game engine, where changes were made and stored so that rewind could be easily included.

### My Role on the Team

My contributions to the project are the items above, which I have mentioned. My role was game player and so I took on the animation and translation of back end data (game engine) into the game view, while Henry created the game view itself. Displaying the backend’s data required close and frequent conversation with game engine so that the features which they added could be properly displayed. I also wrote the code for the controller and so that required working with data. In this regard, having to communicate with game engine and data, I was a bit of a generalist in that my ideas were present in design for both of those as well as game player. I worked on several features as well, such as rewind, achievements, specific splash screens specified by the user, pause, play, save and load. As mentioned, I was frequently updating the view so that it could keep track with backend features as well as be more appealing. 


## Summary

### My biggest strength as a team member

I liked taking on a leadership role within the team. I felt as if I had good general knowledge of all parts of the project, and being someone who is collected and levelheaded, I do not easily get frustrated with people. Because of this, I was often able to fairly delegate tasks and when I asked questions of others to figure out how their implementations were working, they did not get offended, but rather were keen to help. I wasn’t afraid to ask questions and as a result I had a strong working knowledge of our entire game, which I believe was reflected in my role in our team presentation. 

### My biggest weakness as a team member

I could have been better with commenting my code so that others would be able to more easily see the functionality of my parts. As a member of game player, the repercussions for my hasty commenting weren’t that bad, but time was still wasted explaining what I had written.

### How I have improved as a team mate this semester

I have learned to be more accountable. With fast-approaching deadlines and others depending on my functionality to do their parts, I have learned the importance of doing a good job and doing a good job on time. If you don’t make your contributions in a timely and effective manner, no one else can contribute and the whole team suffers. The collective action problem can only be solved if everyone is willing to (and actually does) do their parts, and that will not happen unless people hold themselves accountable. Prior to this class, my group projects had been limited to research papers and honestly I have slacked knowing that others would make up my work, but in computer science where if you do not add a feature, the entire thing simply fails to work, the difference between a truly good team, where everyone contributes, and a bad team is more noticeable. In computer science (and CS308 specifically), if you don’t do your part, the console fills with red and the whole thing fails, whereas in other group projects, the product is just slightly inferior, but it still functions. In the future, I will bring that 308 group project mindset into all of my group endeavors, academic and extracurricular, because it is simply not right to let others carry your weight and doing so causes the whole effort to decrease in quality.
