# Plan

### Data
Josh Kopen:
- Working on data portion of the project alone so I have all the primary and secondary responsibilities for this entire portion
- First Sprint: Implement the ability to write out proper XML files and read them. Should be able to communicate between authoring environment and the game engine/player through these files.
- Second Sprint: Allow the user to write in groovy and affect the objects using groovy from the authoring environment. Allow the user to create custom images and be able to save these images as files.
